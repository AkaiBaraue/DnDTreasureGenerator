# D&D 5th Edition Treasure Generator

This program is intended to be able to generator loot for use while playing D&D 5th edition. The logic and data is based off of the _Treasure_ chapter in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

It is not done yet, as some tables are still missing data (yes, I'm lazy and have not yet bothered typing it in myself). 

![Fuck if I know what's supposed to go here](Screenshot.png?raw=true "The result of generating loot fora treaasure hoard of CR 0-4")

## TO-DO:

* Fix the remaining data.
* Make the UI less shit.
* Add a way to roll directly on the gem/art object/item tables.
* Add an option to let the program roll different types of gems/art objects when generating loot.
* Add an option to replace the generated coins with gems/art objects.
